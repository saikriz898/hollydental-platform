      "From persistent sensitivity to bleeding gums, here are the top warning signs that mean it's time to book a checkup at Hollyhill Dental.",
    body: `<p>Twice-yearly checkups are the gold standard, but your mouth often tells you it needs attention before then. If any of the seven signs below sound familiar, book a consultation with our team in Cork.</p>
<h3>1. Persistent tooth sensitivity</h3><p>Sensitivity to hot, cold or sweet foods can mean worn enamel or an early cavity.</p>
<h3>2. Bleeding or swollen gums</h3><p>Healthy gums don't bleed. Bleeding while brushing is the earliest sign of gum disease.</p>
<h3>3. Chronic bad breath</h3><p>If brushing and flossing don't fix it, the cause is usually deeper than diet.</p>
<h3>4. Lingering toothaches</h3><p>A constant ache often signals a deep cavity or cracked tooth.</p>
<h3>5. Dry mouth</h3><p>Saliva protects your enamel; chronic dryness raises decay risk significantly.</p>
<h3>6. Jaw clicking or tenderness</h3><p>Common with grinding (bruxism) or TMJ disorders.</p>
<h3>7. Sores or patches that won't heal</h3><p>Anything in your mouth that lingers more than two weeks should be examined.</p>
<p>If any of these resonate, please call <strong>+353 21 430 3072</strong> or book online.</p>`,

<h3>Hygiene</h3><p>Invisalign trays come out for brushing and flossing; braces require special tools to clean.</p>
<h3>Compliance</h3><p>Aligners only work if worn 22 hours a day; braces are fixed and continuous.</p>
<h3>Complex cases</h3><p>Severe crowding or rotated teeth still respond best to fixed appliances.</p>

    body: `<p>Composite bonding is one of our most popular cosmetic dentistry treatments at Hollyhill Dental. It offers a fast, non-invasive, and cost-effective way to transform your smile. Here is everything you need to know about the procedure.</p>
<h3>What is Composite Bonding?</h3><p>It involves applying a tooth-colored composite resin to the surface of your teeth to reshape them, close gaps, or cover chips and discoloration. Dr. Roghay Alizadeh sculpts the resin by hand to match your surrounding teeth perfectly.</p>
<h3>Key Benefits</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Single appointment:</strong> Most bonding treatments are completed in just 1 to 2 hours.</li>
  <li><strong>No tooth preparation:</strong> Unlike porcelain veneers, composite bonding requires little to no removal of natural enamel.</li>
  <li><strong>Pain-free:</strong> In most cases, no injections or drilling are necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Long Does It Last?</h3>
<p>Typically, composite bonding lasts between 5 to 8 years. Over time, the resin can stain or wear down, but it can be easily repaired or polished during your regular checkup.</p>

    body: `<p>Dental emergencies can be stressful, but knowing how to react in the first few minutes can mean the difference between saving and losing a tooth. At Hollyhill Dental, we reserve emergency slots daily for patients in urgent need.</p>
<h3>1. Knocked-Out Tooth</h3><p>Handle the tooth only by the crown (the top part), not the root. Rinse it gently with water or milk, and if possible, try to place it back in the socket. If not, store it in a container of milk and head to our clinic immediately.</p>
<h3>2. Severe Toothache</h3><p>Rinse your mouth with warm water and use dental floss to remove any trapped food. Avoid placing aspirin directly on the gums, as this can burn the tissue. Take over-the-counter pain relief and call us to be seen.</p>
<h3>3. Lost Crown or Filling</h3><p>Keep the crown safe if it has come off. You can use temporary dental cement from a pharmacy to temporarily place it back in mouth, but avoid using superglue. Schedule an appointment to get it professionally bonded.</p>

<h3>Gingivitis vs. Periodontitis</h3><p>Gingivitis is the earliest stage of gum disease, characterized by red, swollen gums that bleed when you brush. It is completely reversible with professional cleaning. If left untreated, it can progress to periodontitis, which damages the bone supporting your teeth, leading to loose teeth.</p>

<h3>The 'White Diet'</h3><p>For the first 48 hours post-whitening, the pores of your enamel are open and vulnerable to staining. Avoid coffee, tea, red wine, curry, and soy sauce. Opt for light-colored foods like chicken, pasta, rice, and milk.</p>
<h3>Daily maintenance habits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use a straw when drinking colored beverages.</li>
  <li>Rinse your mouth with water immediately after eating staining foods.</li>
  <li>Brush with a gentle whitening toothpaste to prevent surface stains from building up.</li>

<h3>Dental Implants</h3><p>Implants replace both the root and the crown. A titanium post is surgically placed in the jaw, fusing with the bone. It behaves like a natural tooth and doesn't require any alteration of adjacent teeth.</p>
<h3>Dental Bridges</h3><p>A bridge uses adjacent healthy teeth (anchors) to hold a replacement tooth in the gap. It is non-surgical and completed in 2 visits, but it requires preparing the adjacent teeth.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Value</h3><p>While implants have a higher initial cost, they can last a lifetime, making them the most cost-effective and premium solution in the long run.</p>
